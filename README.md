# breeze.
an indev ubg project made in astro because:
1. i haven't used astro in so long and needed to exercise my skills
2. i needed a clean ubg site to use
3. i kinda wanted some movies on my school chromebook
4. i have nothing else to work on
5. i got mad at nautilusos because something wouldnt work, so what better to do than use typescript instead of js

## roadmap and things i wanna add
- [ ] games (ofc)
- [ ] apps (ofc)
- [ ] proxy (ofc)
- [ ] movies

- [ ] game share
- [ ] watch together
- [ ] vc
- [ ] lots more social stuff lol

## deployment
you can deploy this to netlify out-of-the-box, but to deploy to vercel, you need to install the `@astrojs/vercel` package and switch the adapter in `astro.config.mjs`. for local deployment, take a look at the instructions below:

#### step 1: clone
run the following command in your terminal (make sure you have git before you do this)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/x8rr/breeze.git
```

#### step 2: install
now open up that folder and run the following command. keep in mind you can use your package manager of choice. i use bun
```bash
bun i
```

#### step 3: start the server
finally, you can start your server by doing one of the following
```bash
astro dev # use astro to start a dev server
vite # use vite to start a server
bun start # use your package manager to start a server
```

thats it really, super easy deployment.

## if you fork...
please star the project :P

also make sure you dont do the following:
- modify the agpl license
- claim this code as yours
- not give adequate credits
- use this in your website without credits
- detatch from fork network without giving credits
- do anything that violates the license
- literally just steal this and run away with it

but you can:
- deploy it without any changes made
- deploy it WITH changes (as long as credit is included and changes are included)
- some more other stuff that i cant remember

i recommend including this to stay safe:
